This project forecasts the next 24 hours of electricity demand for a commercial site and develops a battery dispatch strategy to minimise electricity costs under a time-varying tariff. 

The assessment combines:

- Exploratory time-series analysis

- Feature engineering

- XGBoost modelling

- A baseline naive benchmark

- Linear programming (cvxpy) battery optimisation

The work is presented in a single Jupyter notebook.
